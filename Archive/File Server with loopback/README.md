Usage:

1. Open two terminal tabs
2. Run Server.py in one terminal
3. Run Client.py in the other
4. In the client enter the absolute path to a file
5. See the copy that was made at that path, with the original name appended as .new

Troubleshooting:

If you get an error opening the socket, ensure port 5000 is open on your machine and that it isn't currently being used by a different instance of the application
